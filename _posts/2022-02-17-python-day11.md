## 1. 서론

&nbsp;&nbsp;파이썬 공부를 위해 Udemy에 있는 [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) 과정을 듣고 있다. 이 포스트에서는 Day1-100 중 Day11에서 풀었던 문제들을 리뷰해보려고 한다.

## 2. 본론

### 1. Days in Month

&nbsp;&nbsp;문제는 아래의 주어진 조건에 도전할 난이도를 선택하고, 그에 따른 힌트들을 참고해서 블랙잭 게임을 할 수 있는 코드를 짜는 것이었다.

```
############### Blackjack Project #####################

#Difficulty Normal 😎: Use all Hints below to complete the project.
#Difficulty Hard 🤔: Use only Hints 1, 2, 3 to complete the project.
#Difficulty Extra Hard 😭: Only use Hints 1 & 2 to complete the project.
#Difficulty Expert 🤯: Only use Hint 1 to complete the project.

############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
#user_cards = []
#computer_cards = []

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
```

```

for i in range(2):
  i = random.choice(cards)
  users.append(i)
for i in range(2):
  i = random.choice(cards)
  computers.append(i)

users_score = 0
computers_score = 0

def blackjack():
	should_continue = True
	while should_continue:
		users_score = sum(users)
		computers_score = sum(computers)
		print(f"Your card: {users}, current score: {users_score}")
		print(f"Computer's first card: {computers[0]}")
		if computers_score == 21:
			print("computer is win. Blackjack")
			break			
		elif computers_score != 21 and users_score == 21:
			print("you are win. Blackjack")
			break
		elif users_score > 21: 
			print("you are lose.")
			break
		more_card = input("Do you want to get another card? Type 'y' or 'n': ")
		if more_card == "y":
			users.append(random.choice(cards))
			blackjack()
		elif more_card == "n":
			should_continue = False
			while sum(computers) < 17:
				computers.append(random.choice(cards))
			if sum(users) > sum(computers):
				print(f"Your final hand: {users}, final score: {sum(users)}")
				print(f"Computer's final hand: {computers}, final score: {sum(computers)}")
				print("You win")
				break
			elif sum(users) < sum(computers):
				print(f"Your final hand: {users}, final score: {sum(users)}")
				print(f"Computer's final hand: {computers}, final score: {sum(computers)}")
				print("Computer win")
				break
			else:
				print(f"Your final hand: {users}, final score: {sum(users)}")
				print(f"Computer's final hand: {computers}, final score: {sum(computers)}")
				print("Draw")
				break

정답으로 제시된 코드와 비교해보며 배운점이나 느낀점은
- 무려 2시간을 고민하면서 짰는데 결국 완성시키지 못했다.
- 우선 난이도를 잘못 선택했다. 고작 10일 배워놓고 Extra Hard를 선택하다니.. 그만큼 오래 고민하며 생각한 부분도 많긴하지만.. 잘못된 선택이었다.
- 가장 어려웠던 부분은 무엇을 어떻게 나눠서 구현해야 하는지 적절한 판단을 하지 못했다는 점이다. 그동안 가이드를 보며 순서대로 만드는 것에만 익숙해져 있었고, 무엇보다 아직 그렇게 하는 것도 마스터하지 못했다는 추가적인 문제점이 있다.
- 처음으로 variable scope(변수의 유효 범위), 즉 지역변수와 전역변수를 구분해서 사용해야 하는 문제에 부딪혔다.
- 그 외에 블랙잭을 판단할 때, 카드 갯수가 2개여야 한다는 점을 놓쳤다.

## 3. 결론

&nbsp;&nbsp;이번 포스팅에서는 그동안 배운것을 총동원해서 문제를 풀어보려고 시도했다. 아직 11일차이지만 불과 2,3일 전보다는 확실히 나아졌다는 느낌이 들지만 반대로 아직 아무 가이드 없이 a-z로 코딩하기엔 한없이 부족하다는 것을 느꼈다.
